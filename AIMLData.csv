### Risks
Deceptive explanations: Some XAI methods can generate 'plausible' explanations that don't actually match the underlying mathematical reality of how the model works."
hitl,Human-in-the-loop (HITL),Governance,Adopt,Strategic,Manual review integrated into automated workflows.,,"### Definition
Human-in-the-loop (HITL) is an architectural pattern where an AI system pauses at critical decision points to wait for human review, approval, or correction.

### Application
High-stakes enterprise automation (e.g. paying an invoice > $5,000) where the AI handles 95% of the data prep but the final 'Send' requires a human finger.

### Risks
Automation bias: Over time, humans become accustomed to the AI being right and may start 'rubber-stamping' its outputs without actually reviewing them carefully."
roi-modeling,AI ROI Modeling,Governance,Adopt,Strategic,Calculating business value vs. compute cost.,,"### Definition
AI ROI (Return on Investment) Modeling is the financial practice of measuring the actual business impact (productivity, revenue) against the total cost of AI ownership.

### Application
Justifying the multi-million dollar GPU budgets to boards and CFOs by proving that AI is driving concrete efficiencies rather than just serving as a 'cool feature'.

### Risks
Hard-to-measure gains: It's easy to calculate API costs, but measuring the 'saved time' of an engineer or the 'better quality' of a marketing plan is notoriously difficult."
hallucination-mgmt,Hallucination Management,Governance,Adopt,High,Methods to detect and prevent model hallucinations.,,"### Definition
Hallucination Management is a system-level approach that uses multi-step verification and external 'fact-checkers' to ensure that every AI output is grounded in truth.

### Application
Protecting corporate brand trust by ensuring that customer-facing agents never 'make up' fake policies, prices, or product features.

### Risks
False Fact-checking: If theFact-checker itself is a model, you now have two models that could potentially hallucinate together, creating a 'hallucination loop'."
data-leakage-prev,Data Leakage Prevention,Governance,Adopt,Critical,"Ensuring test data doesn't contaminate training.",,"### Definition
Data Leakage Prevention is the strict separation of training, validation, and test datasets to ensure that the model doesn't 'see the answers' before it is tested.

### Application
Critical for predictive accuracy. If leakage occurs, a model will look perfect in the lab but fail completely when it encounters truly new data in the real world.

### Risks
Temporal leakage: In time-series data, it is very easy to accidentally train on 'future' data (e.g. using tomorrow's price to predict today's), which is impossible in production."
model-drift-adopt,Model Drift,Governance,Adopt,Strategic,Monitoring for accuracy decay in live environments.,,"### Definition
Model Drift (or Concept Drift) is the phenomenon where a model's performance degrades because the underlying relationships in the real-world data have changed.

### Application
Regularly re-training recommendation or fraud models to ensure they stay relevant as user fashions change or as criminals invent new ways to bypass security.

### Risks
Silent failure: Unlike code that 'breaks' with an error message, a drifting model will keep giving 'successful' answers that are just increasingly wrong and irrelevant."
fitting,Overfitting / Underfitting,Governance,Adopt,High,Managing model generalization vs. memorization.,,"### Definition
Overfitting is when a model memorizes its training data too perfectly, losing the ability to generalize. Underfitting is when the model is too simple to learn the patterns at all.

### Application
Fine-tuning the 'Sweet Spot' of training duration and model size to ensure it works well on the specific data it was trained on AND all future unknown data.

### Risks
Memorization leakage: Overfitted models can sometimes 'spout out' verbatim training data, which could include private user info if not carefully scrubbed."
forgetting,Catastrophic Forgetting,Governance,Adopt,High,Preventing the loss of old skills during new training.,,"### Definition
Catastrophic Forgetting is the tendency of an artificial neural network to completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information.

### Application
Continuous learning systems. If you train a model to 'code in Python' and then 'code in Java', it might lose its ability to write valid Python if not trained carefully.

### Risks
Maintenance cost: To prevent forgetting, you often have to re-train the model on 'a little bit of everything' every time you want to teach it something new."
differential-privacy,Differential Privacy,Governance,Trial,High,Noise-based privacy protection for datasets.,,"### Definition
Differential Privacy is a mathematical framework that adds a precisely calculated amount of 'noise' to a dataset so that individual records cannot be identified, but group patterns remain.

### Application
Training AI on highly sensitive personal data (e.g. medical or financial) while providing a mathematical guarantee that no individual's private data can be extracted.

### Risks
Accuracy loss: There is a direct trade-off (the 'Epsilon Budget') between how much privacy you have and how accurate the resulting model will be."
constitutional-ai,Constitutional AI,Governance,Trial,Very High,Alignment via a set of high-level principles.,,"### Definition
Constitutional AI is an alignment method where the model is given a set of written 'principles' (a constitution) and trains itself by critiquing its own behavior against them.

### Application
Scaling safety without manual human labeling. It allows a model to learn complex ethical behaviors (like being 'harmless' and 'honest') through self-reflection.

### Risks
Ambiguous principles: If the 'Constitution' is poorly written or contains conflicting values, the model may develop erratic or confusing behavior."
green-ai,Green AI / Sustainability,Governance,Assess,Medium,Optimizing carbon footprint and power usage.,,"### Definition
Green AI is the practice of optimizing model training and inference to minimize its environmental impact, focusing on energy efficiency and carbon-aware scheduling.

### Application
Corporate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance. It involves moving compute to regions with 100% renewable energy and using sparse models (MoE) to lower power draw.

### Risks
Performance cap: Sometimes the most energy-efficient model is not the most accurate one, forcing companies to choose between sustainability and state-of-the-art power."
zk-data-prep,Zero-Knowledge Data Prep,Governance,Experimental,Very High,Provable data compliance without revealing raw data.,,"### Definition
Zero-Knowledge Data Prep uses ZK-proofs to prove that a dataset was cleaned, balanced, and sanitized according to specific rules, without actually showing the data to the auditor.

### Application
High-trust environments like government or banking where a regulator needs to confirm data quality without the risk of seeing private citizen data.

### Risks
Computational extreme: Generating ZK-proofs for millions of data points is currently orders of magnitude more expensive than standard data processing."
agi-gov,AGI Governance Frameworks,Governance,Experimental,Strategic,Policies for handling super-intelligent autonomy.,,"### Definition
AGI Governance refers to the long-term policy frameworks and international agreements needed to manage systems that reach or exceed human-level intelligence across all domains.

### Application
Existential risk management. It involves planning for 'fast takeoff' scenarios where an AI could theoretically escape human control or manipulate global systems.

### Risks
Speculative nature: Because AGI doesn't exist yet, these frameworks are based on theoretical models and simulations, making them hard to test against real-world reality."
